Hi this is max<code>^<code>s place! I got a PhD in 2023 and decided to leave academics (though it still kinda feels like I'm trying..). Sometimes I hobble around and take pictures of places (not so) here and there. Other times I forget (how) to update this website, but so it goes... I'll add things as they come along (and as I choose to add them)


This website was made with [jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [basically-basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) theme.

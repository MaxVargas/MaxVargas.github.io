Hi this is max<code>^<code>s place! I got a PhD at some point and I've been trying to escape academia ever since. I've not done a very good job at it, but mayhaps one day I can get out and just do the things I want. There was one time I hobbled around and took pictures of places (not so) here and there. Sometimes I forget (how) to update this but that's your problem!!! I'll add things as they come along (and as I choose to add them!)
